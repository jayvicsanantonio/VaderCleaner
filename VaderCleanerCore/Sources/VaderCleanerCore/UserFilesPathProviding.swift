// UserFilesPathProviding.swift
// Resolves the home-directory subtrees the Large & Old Files scanner walks, plus the fixed-path Apple Music media folders it excludes by path so the scan never trips a macOS privacy prompt.

import Foundation

/// Test seam between `LargeOldFilesScanner` and the real macOS home layout.
/// Implementations return the concrete `[URL]` to feed into a scan. Tests
/// inject a stub returning paths under a temp directory, which is why the
/// production `DefaultUserFilesPathProvider` lives behind the same protocol
/// instead of being a free function on the scanner.
///
/// Distinct from `SystemPathProviding` — that one carries a `ScanCategory`
/// per root because the System Junk feature decides "this is junk because of
/// where it lives". Large & Old files are classified by content (size, last
/// access date), so the root list is pure URLs and the scanner does the
/// per-file tagging.

    /// The fixed-path TCC-protected media folders under `roots()` that must be
    /// folded into the scan's exclusion list — the Apple Music media folder and
    /// the legacy iTunes folder. These are plainly-named directories, so they
    /// cannot be recognised by name mid-walk and must be excluded by path.
